<h2>About Docket Science</h2>

<p>Welcome to <b>Docket Science</b>, the future of documents. 
    Through Docket Science's refined Machine Learning, 
    we will eventually sort through data and extract meaningful 
    and invaluable information about society for society. 
    You will not have to be a data scientist in order to make sense of data. 
    Back then, you had to be part of a select few in order to operate a computer, 
    but computer science has advanced past being unimaginably difficult to understand 
    and is now utilized by many. Technology has now put us in a position where more 
    people can create meaningful and impressive content. Our hope about the future of 
    documents is that it will be easily understood and useful beyond imagination. 
    Thank you.
